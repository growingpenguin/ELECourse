Atom(원자): <br/>
Smallest unit that makes up everyday materials <br/>
Basic element of chemical elements <br/>
Units that cannot be broken down further through chemical reactions <br/>
Everyday around us, including solids, liquids, gases, plasma, is made up of atoms <br/>
-They contain subatomic particles in their nucleus and in the electronic cloud that surrounds the nucleus <br/>
-Types of subatomic particles: <br/>
Protons(양성자) and neutrons(중성자) are located in the nucleus <br/>
Electrons(전자) are located in the cloud, or field that surrounds the nucleus <br/>
Protons(양성자)-positive charge <br/>
Neutrons(중성자)-no charge <br/>
Electrons(전자)-negative charge <br/>
Number of P(proton) = Number of E(electron) <br/>
Atoms are electronically neutral particles <br/>

**Shells surrounding the nucleus** <br/>
Carbon atomic structure <br/>
6 protons(양성자), 6 electrons(전자), and most cases 6 neutrons(중성자) <br/>
-Electrons are in simple shell / rings surrounding the nucleus <br/>
-Each shell represent a different energy level and can only hold a certain number of electrons <br/>
-In chemical reactions between atoms, only the electrons in the outermost shell participate in chemical bonds <br/> 
-In atoms with only one energy level or shell, two electrons require stability <br/>
-Example1: Helium <br/>
![ELE1_3](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/71b9388a-4c7d-44c7-b81e-a293c20706d2) <br/>
(Ref: https://stock.adobe.com/kr/images/helium-atom-model-chemical-element/498668529) <br/>
1 Shell / Energy level <br/>
1st shell can have only two electrons <br/>
Helium is stable, and there is no naturally occuring compound containing Helium <br/>
-Example2: Hydrogen <br/>
![ELE1_2](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/8ea1f0f5-a7ca-4027-a9c8-416d23205f40) <br/>
(Ref: https://www.vectorstock.com/royalty-free-vector/hydrogen-atom-on-white-background-vector-21316030) <br/>
1 Shell / Energy level <br/>
Possess only one electron in its shell, so it is chemically reactive <br/>
-Example3: Neon <br/>
![ELE1_4](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/636b2745-cf55-4ced-b592-0db3f1c05427) <br/>
(Ref: https://www.quora.com/How-is-neon-different-from-oxygen) <br/>
In atoms with more than one energy or shell <br/>
8 electrons are required in its outermost shell for stablility <br/>
Neon has 8 electrons in its outermost shell, which makes it stable <br/>
-Example4: Oxygen <br/>
![ELE1_5](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/0211b4eb-fbce-40c2-b5c6-be9c2de66cfc) <br/>
Oxygen has 6 electrons in its outermost shell, is chemically reactive <br/>
-Octet Rule <br/>
![ELE1_6](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/f78ec5e5-4e2f-4b98-9a89-8890208dfe79) <br/>
Atoms with fewer than 8 electrons in their outermost shell will try to share, gain, or lose electronics to become stable <br/>
Exceptions exist. Hydrogen and helium have only one energy level or shell <br/>

### Current(전류), Voltage(전압), and Resistance(저항)
**Current(전류)** <br/>
:Flow of electrons(전자) in a circuit <br/>
-To use electricity, we need electrons to flow in the same direction around the circuit <br/>
-Copper cables are widely used for electrical wiring because copper is a very good conductor of electricity <br/>
The reason for this lies in the atomic structure of copper <br/>
In copper atoms, there are electrons in the outer shell, also known as the valence shell, which are not tightly bound to the atom's nucleus. These loosely bound electrons are free to move throughout the copper metal <br/>
When a potential difference(like from a battery or a power source) is applied across a copper wire, these free electrons start to move from the negative end towards the positive end, creating an electric current. This movement is relatively easy because the electrons are not strongly attracted to any particular copper atom, which means they can move through the wire with less resistance compared to materials with more tightly bound electrons <br/>
So, when creating a circuit, using copper cables is advantageous because the material's atomic structure allows for easy flow of electricity, making the circuit efficient for conducting electric current <br/>
-Free electrons move randomly to other copper atoms and in any directions <br/>
But what we need is to make the elctrons move to the same direction along the circuit <br/>
-We can place things like lamps in the way of these electrons so they flow through it and generate light and heat etc <br/>
-Apply a voltage to a circuit to push the electrons <br/> 
Voltage is like a pressure in a water pipe <br/>
The more pressure we have, the more water can flow <br/>
The more voltage we have, the more electrons can flow <br/> 
-More Voltage = More Current <br/>
More Current = Brighter Lamp <br/>
-However, the cable and lamps can only handle a certain amount of electrons passing through them <br/>
Just like a pipe is rated to handle a certain amount of water <br/>
If too many electrons pass through the cable or lamp, they will burst or burn out <br/>
-Refer to the flow of electrons as current and measure this in the unit of Ampheres(Amps), represented with a capital A <br/>
3A Fuse <br/>

(Ref:https://www.toolstation.com/plug-top-fuse/p62399) <br/>
Rated for 3 amps of current <br/>
Laptop Charger <br/>
![ELE1_8](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/03ef1523-a98e-4b3c-8a41-b59f25e6388b) <br/>
(Ref: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Posj4WMo0o) <br/>
-Manufacturor label tells you what product it decides to handle <br/>
-Example: 
For the device to work, it needs an input between 100 ~ 240V, AC 1.5amps <BR/>
Charger converts this to given output of 19.5V and 3.3 amps of DC <br/>
-AC(Alternating Current) and DC(Dirrect Current) are different kinds of electricity <br/>
AC(Alternating Current): Electrons do not flow in a continuous loop <br/>
Alternate between moving backwards and forwards, just like tides of the sea <br/>
Example: <br/> 
Plugs in your home <br/>
Power stations <br/>
Transport using AC and send it to our cities and homes <br/>
Used AC, because it is more efficient to transport over long distances <br/>
Can use simple transformers to change the voltage <br/>
DC(Direct Current): Electrons flow in one direction <br/>
Flow of water in the river <br/>
Example: <br/>
Electronic Devices like laptops and mobile phones <br/>
Circuit boards of small electronic devices like laptops, mobile phones, and television <br/>
DC is less complex and allow circuit boards and devices to be more compact <br/>
-AC & DC combination <br/>
Example: Washing Machine <br/>
AC for induction motor(Spin tub with clothes in) & DC for control circuit board(setting, lights, and timers,and how fast the motor spins) <br/>
-Inverter(인버터) <br/>

**What is Resistance** <br/>
Resistance: Barrier that slows down the flow of electricity <br/>
It limits how much current can flow through it <br/>
-Imagine materials have free electrons moving inside them, which gives them electrical properties, allowing current to flow <br/>
These free electrons need to move between the atoms that make up the material <br/>
However, they get disrupted by bumping into these atoms, which slows them down. This slowing down of electron movement is what we call resistance. In electrical diagrams, there's a special symbol used to represent a resistor, which is the component that adds resistance to a circuit. <br/>

**Ohm's Law** <br/>
Link between Current(전류), Voltage(전압), and Resistance(저항) within Electrical Circuits <br/>
Example1: Basic Electric Curcuit of a Battery <br/>

-Connects wire and the resistor <br/>
(1)Battery creates a potential difference between energy states(voltage) <br/> 
(2)Causes electrons to travel through the connected wire, the currents <br/>
(3)Travels through the resistor <br/>
(4)Travels back through the battery <br/>

### Theory(Element) 
**(1)LM386** <br/>
a.Concept
![ELE1_11](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/1f69acb6-0845-4601-b639-a0ac875d8851) <br/>
LM386 <br/>
:A type of audio amplifier that is designed primarily for low-power applications(Designed to operate with a small amount of electric power) <br/> 
-It operates on a supply voltage ranging from +4V to +15V. Meaning it can function properly when it is connected to a power source that provides a voltage anywhere between 4V and 15V <br/> 
-The inputs of the LM386 are referenced to ground, and the internal circuitry automatically biases the output signal to half the supply voltage <br/> 
Inputs Referenced to Ground: <br/>
In any electrical circuit, "ground" is considered the reference point against which all voltages are measured <br/>
Therefore meaning that the inverting and non-inverting inputs (the points where you would apply the audio signal you want to amplify) <br/>
are measured with respect to the ground level of the circuit. This is a common setup for audio amplifiers as it helps to define the signal levels clearly <br/>
Automatic Biasing to Half the Supply Voltage: <br/>
"Biasing" in electronics refers to applying a steady voltage to an electronic device to establish a reference point for its operation <br/> For an amplifier, proper biasing is critical because it determines the amplifier's operating range and ensures that the output signal can fluctuate equally around this reference point without being clipped <br/>
Figure Description: <br/>
-Gain: Pin 1 is typically used to set the gain of the amplifier. By default, the LM386 has a gain of 20, but you can increase it to a gain of 200 by connecting a capacitor between pins 1 and 8 <br/>
"Gain" in electronics, especially when discussing amplifiers, refers to the ability of the device to increase the power or amplitude of a signal from its input to its output. It is essentially a measure of how much an amplifier "amplifies" the signal <br/>
-Inverting Input: This is the negative input for the audio signal. In an operational amplifier, this would be the input that causes the output to decrease when the input signal increases <br/>
-Noninverting Input: The positive input for the audio signal. For the LM386, this pin is where the audio input signal is typically applied. An increase in the signal at this pin results in an increase at the output <br/>
-Ground: This pin is connected to the ground of the circuit <br/>
-Output: The amplified audio signal comes out from this pin <br/>
-V+ Supply: The positive voltage supply for the IC. The LM386 can operate from 4V to 12V, but 9V is a common choice <br/>
-Bypass: This pin can be connected to a capacitor that bypasses noise from the power supply. It is not always used, and if left unconnected, it is internally connected to the ground <br/>
-Gain: Pin 8 is also used to adjust the gain in conjunction with pin 1 <br/>
